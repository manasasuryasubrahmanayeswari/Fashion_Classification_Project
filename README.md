# Fashion Classification Project

This project is a **fashion image classifier** that uses machine learning/deep learning to categorize images of clothing into different categories (e.g., shirts, shoes, dresses, etc.).

## Project Overview
- Built using **Python** and **TensorFlow/Keras** (or PyTorch if you used that)
- Uses image datasets like **Fashion MNIST** (or your dataset)
- Trains a model to classify clothing items
- Visualizes accuracy and loss during training

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manasasuryasubrahmanayeswari/Fashion_Classification_Project.git
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter/Colab notebook and run the cells.
